AVL Trees
=========

left-left (right-right)
* the leftmost (rightmost) child node is the tallest child tree
* images on slides

left-right (right-left)
* the left child's right node is the tallest child tree
* images on slides

localisation
------------
* imbalance can only occur on the insertion path
* balancing should occur at the lowest possible point (shuffle as little of the tree as possible)

> for procrastination: build AVL tree on BST structure
